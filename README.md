# 🌟 IQ Enhancing Games for Kids with Autism

Welcome to the **IQ Enhancing Games** platform, a suite of interactive, educational, and sensory-friendly games specifically designed for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This project aims to provide a safe, engaging environment for cognitive development and social-emotional learning (SEL).

## 🚀 Project Overview

This platform features seven unique "planets" (games) and a comprehensive assessment tool. Each game is crafted to target specific developmental milestones, including memory, pattern recognition, spatial awareness, and emotional intelligence.

## 🌈 How It Helps Kids with Autism

This project was built with a "sensory-first" approach:

1.  **Sensory-Friendly Design**: Uses a calming **Pastel Color Palette** and avoids high-contrast or flashing elements that can cause sensory overload.
2.  **Social-Emotional Learning (SEL)**: The *Emotion Garden* specifically helps children identify and process different emotions through interactive storytelling.
3.  **Clear & Simple HUD**: Minimalistic UI ensures that the child focuses only on the core activity without being distracted by unnecessary buttons or ads.
4.  **Positive Reinforcement**: Every success is celebrated with visual rewards and encouraging text, fostering a growth mindset.
5.  **Predictable Patterns**: Logical game mechanics provide a sense of structure and routine, which is often comforting for kids with ASD.
